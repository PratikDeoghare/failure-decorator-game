In this game you must decorate every function with failWithProbability
decorator so that it doesn't always work. Your task is to get the job done even
in presence of functions that might fail. 

Example task: 

  1. Write bubbleSort where swap function fails with probability 0.5

I expect things to work perfectly in the real world which is not true. 

Have fun!
